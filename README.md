Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Internship: Syntecxhub – Data Science  
Week 3 – Project 1: Titanic Dataset EDA

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger survival patterns using Python.
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset using Pandas
- Checked dataset structure and missing values
- Cleaned the data by:
  - Filling missing age values with the median
  - Dropping the Cabin column due to many missing values
  - Filling missing Embarked values with the most frequent category
- Created visualizations to analyze survival patterns:
  - Survival count
  - Survival by gender
  - Survival by passenger class
  - Age distribution of passengers

Key Insights
- More women survived than men, which suggests that women were given priority during the rescue.
- Passengers travelling in 1st class had higher survival chances compared to those in lower classes.
- Children were more likely to survive than adults.
- Overall, most passengers did not survive, showing how tragic the Titanic accident was.
